Your task is to write a Python function '{function_header}' that {function_description}. You may use built-ins, but limit your usage so the function has enough logic in it; you are not allowed to use numpy. Make the logic in your function as explicit as possible, and make sure that the result returned by your function is deterministic. Do not include comments, and do not output any extra information.
