You are given a Python function named '{function_name}' below, which {function_description}. Your goal is to generate 3 simple test inputs for this function that comprehensively test all functionality of the ‘{function_name}‘ function and produce no errors when executed. Do NOT include any extra information and put each input on a separate line. If the function has EXACTLY ONE parameter, output a SINGLE Python LIST literal (e.g., [1, 2, 3]). If the function has MORE THAN ONE parameter, output a SINGLE TUPLE literal containing ALL arguments in order (e.g., ([1, 2, 3], 1, 3) or ([2, 2], True)). Do NOT include floating-point values. Make sure that lists contain only a few elements, but are not empty. Generate only Python literals (lists, tuples, ints, bools) for the inputs. Do NOT use sets, dicts, iter(...), range(...), generator expressions, or function calls.
